I work as a Computer Vision Research Engineer at [DreamVu](https://dreamvu.com/) building perception systems for robots. I do R&D on image processing, stereoscopic depth detection & semantic segmentation.

I previously worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Game Theory](https://www.gametheory.in/) where I detected, triangulated & tracked objects using multiple cameras for sports.

As a researcher at [RRC](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) & [PreCog](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/), I've worked on Robotic Perception, Vision Language Models & Codemixing in NLP. I've had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof. Madahava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) and [Prof. Sourav Garg](https://oravus.github.io/).  

I graduated from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with a B.Tech (Honours) in Computer Science & Engineering.

I play Table Tennis, follow every other sport and try to make music. I enjoy reading about science, tech and politics.
