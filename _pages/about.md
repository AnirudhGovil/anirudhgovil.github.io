I work as a Computer Vision Research Engineer at [DreamVu](https://dreamvu.com/). A day of work would see me read the latest work in the area, scientifically test the image processing pipelines that perform depth detection and semantic segmentation and propose improvements to the same.

I previously worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Game Theory](https://www.gametheory.in/) where I built the core calibration, traingulation and detection pipelines for shuttles/ball tracking in sports videos.

I studied Computer Science and Engineering at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) where I graduated with a B.Tech with Honours.

I've had the pleasure of being advised by [Madahava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) and [Sourav Garg](https://oravus.github.io/), as I worked on Semantic Segmentation, Vision Language Models, Robotic Control and Codemixing in NLP. 

I enjoy Sci-Fi in all mediums, play Table Tennis, follow every other sport and try to make music. I'd love to listen to what you have to say about anything science, tech and philosophy.
