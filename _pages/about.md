I work as a Computer Vision Research Engineer at [DreamVu](https://dreamvu.com/). I perform R&D on image processing pipelines that perform stereoscopic depth detection and semantic segmentation.

I previously worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Game Theory](https://www.gametheory.in/) where I built the core calibration, triangulation and detection pipelines for shuttle/ball tracking in sports videos.

I studied Computer Science and Engineering at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) where I graduated with a B.Tech with Honours. 

As a researcher, I've had the pleasure of being advised by Professors [Madahava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) and [Sourav Garg](https://oravus.github.io/), as I worked on Semantic Segmentation, Vision Language Models, Robotic Control and Codemixing in NLP. 

I play Table Tennis, follow every other sport and try to make music. I'd love to listen to what you have to say about anything science, tech and politics.
