I work as a Computer Vision Research Engineer at [DreamVu](https://dreamvu.com/). I do R&D on stereoscopic depth detection and semantic segmentation for omnidrectional videos.

I previously worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Game Theory](https://www.gametheory.in/) where I built the core camera calibration, triangulation and detection pipelines for shuttle/ball trajectory tracking for sports.

I have a B.Tech with Honours in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).

As a researcher, I've worked on Semantic Segmentation, Vision Language Models, Robotic Control and Codemixing in NLP. I've had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof. Madahava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) and [Prof. Sourav Garg](https://oravus.github.io/).  

I play Table Tennis, follow every other sport and try to make music. I enjoy reading about science, tech and politics.
